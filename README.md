# Mantine Example Playground

A Hone-inspired React + TypeScript + Vite playground that showcases a variety of Mantine UI components—from hero shells and planners to forms, tables, carousels, and dropzones. Use it as a quick reference when experimenting with Mantine patterns or presenting UI ideas to teammates.

## Prerequisites

```

## Available Scripts
